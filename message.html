                    Hi love ❤️ so first of all I just want to let you know that you are very special to me and that I'm so happy that I got to meet youu and I'm glad that I did☹️ because to be honest, I honestly do not like Bumble. I just tried it because my friend really told me that I might meet someone there 😭 but yes deep inside me I kinda judged na parang nahhh most people here are probably hoes or something and like play with someone's feelings and leave them. But I guess it's fate that brought us together kahit if friend mo pa yan nag swipe sa akin or something 😭 but yes thank you so much for extending that chat because after talking to you sa Bumble, I knew na okay eto na, I'm deleting the app because yea ikaw na po 🤍. 

                    After that we talked and yea we called and all and yes I began to develop feelings nga talaga. And as much as I was not a clingy person sometimes, I was looking for you na and kinda missing you but yea I didn't have the right and all because yes, walang label ☹️. But yea, I guess that was one of the reasons na I asked u after UP fair because when we were in UP fair, idk if I can be sweet with you or something because yea, I have no right and all 😭. But after I asked u out, ig u told me ur reasons and all love and yes, starting from that day ig our relationship went deeper and all because u were showing me what you called ur "unlikeable side". But yes, that side of urs made me fall much more deeper sa'yo because yes 🥺 ur showing ur true self to me and not hiding. And yes ig that's when I realized how much I love you lablab 🥺 and yes I also feel so loved by you love ☹️ so please don't say na ur not showing enough of it because I swear I made u sad and upset a lot of times na and yet you still choose to stay and love me unconditionally ☹️.

                    Other than that, you always let me know mahal not to overthink and reassure me when I am overthinking or getting jelly 🥺. I am sorry that I cannot be a perfect bf as I made you sad with a lot of mess ups like talking to my ex and the TikTok things ☹️ but I just want to let you know that you're my only bebe girl, so please don't worry or overthink 🤍. But if you do, I will always reassure you and gain your trust. And also whenever we have arguments, I will make sure not to let you sleep with a heavy heart, so please let me know as much as possible if you're feeling heavy because of something love 🤍. 

                    And okay, I know that I wasn't able to ask this last time love, so yes love 🤍 will you take a chance with me 🥺?
